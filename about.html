<p>I'm a grown-ass woman starting over, and coding is one of the tools I've been given in helping rebuild my life. Tag along as I start on an adventure in web development that's already shaping up to be terrifying, difficult, challenging, illuminating, empowering, exciting, and oh-so-worth-it. Obscenities will be screamed. Objects will probably be thrown. But this web development program WILL be completed. Duck and cover your ears if you need to!</p>
